0.11  February 15, 2007

    * Included new heuristics to reinforce the 2nd pass.
      Now the function tries to detect regularities which can lead to false
      positives in headerless files, like columns containing time values,
      comma-separated decimal numbers and numbers containing the comma as the
      group character (the last two cases are usual in some locales, like
      German or Spanish).
    * Changed several croaks to carps. If no candidate passes the tests,
      get_separator returns undef in scalar context and an empty list in
      array context.
    * Updated (and improved) the documentation.
    * Added more tests.
